Project: Adobe APIs Node JS step by step automation script
Contact: dwayneb@adobe.com

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This is a sample Node JS script that runs 'steps' one after the other, waiting for the previous step to complete before moving onto the next one.
Initially the script was built using a series of promises but for time it was updated to work with async anonymous functions. 

The project containts the following folder structure : 

Customer Implementation Files
```
./[customer]                                   | customer namespace
